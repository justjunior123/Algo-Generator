This is a Repo for the Algorithm Generator

First you will need to clone this Repo. Once you clone the repo you need to make sure that you can run vanilla node scripts on your computer. Making sure that you have node installed to, run package.json at the root of this project folder.


In order to run this application to start practicing your algorithm skills you will need to cd into the project folder and run the following.
```
npm start
```
You will be able to select a text editor by moving the arrow keys up and down.

Once you select the text editor that you want to use, you will get to choose the type of data structures that you want to work on. (Use vim its the easiest)

Select the number. Currently there are only three options. 
Example
Type : 1
Hit Enter

Next, you will want to move to the next step and practice the algorithms that were chosen.

Type: done
Hit Enter

As of now all algorithms are a work in progress.... 
In the text editor using Javascript syntax:
return: "Hello World" (Note: options 2 and 3 require "Hello world")

Save and exit your text editor.

The tests will automatically run.

Your will either pass or fail based on the output of your code. 

You will have two more tries to get it right. 

Once done make sure to delete the folder when prompted at the end. Currently working on some bugs to address this.

THX!
